The legacy database (TIM) contains duplicate clients havnig the same `national_id`.
But we want to keep the `unique=True` requirement on `Client.national_id`.
How to solve this:
legacy Clients marked `is_deprecated ` now automaticaly 
get a suffix " (A)" appended to their `national_id`.
(both watch_tim and migrate)
