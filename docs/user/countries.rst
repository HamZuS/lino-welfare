.. _welfare.countries.City:

City
----

A better name would be "geographical place" because 
a City, in Lino, can also be a suburb, a town, 
a province, a lake... any geographic entity 
(except a :ref:`welfare.countries.Country` 
because these have their own table).

.. _welfare.countries.Country:

Country
-------

Many Lino applications have a table of countries.
