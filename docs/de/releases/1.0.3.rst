Version 1.0.3
=============

Maintenance release. Will be installed today evening (2012-11-20).

Bugfixes:

- Setting a column filter on a date column caused a server traceback

- Clicking the "Home" button (the one of Lino's main menu) 
  when at least one window was opened caused the viewport's loadmask 
  to show up forever.
  
- Lino didn't work in Internet Explorer. It said "Invalid procedure call or argument".

- The message "Failed to delete %(record)s : %(error)s." never reached 
  the user, they saw only "'dict' object has no attribute 'has_header'".
  
- Diverse Warnungen im Stil 
  "L'action jobs.ContractsByPerson.do_print a échoué pour Contrat de 
  travail "Contrat de travail#12 (Bernd BRECHT)": 'module' object has 
  no attribute 'Warning'." kamen nie beim Benutzer an.
  
Database change:

- Remove the 'Country.nationalities' field because that idea 
  was utopic anyway.
