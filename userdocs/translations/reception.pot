msgid "The reception module of Lino-Welfare is for managing a reception desk and a waiting queue. Visitors are \"checked in\" as they present themselves at a reception desk (Empfangsschalter), then they wait in a lounge until an agent \"receives\" them, and finally they are \"checked out\" when they leave again. Social agents have a possibility to see how many and which clients are waiting for them."

msgid "A **reception clerk** is the user at the reception desk who welcomes visitors. In the public demo database there is a user \"theresia\" with that profile. Theresia's first questions are usually \"What's your name?\" or \"Do you have an appointment with a social agent?\"."

In that case the reception clerk clicks \"Create Visit\", confirms the selected agent and enters a \"reason\" (a short one-line text). This will automatically create two records: an :ddref:`cal.Event` and a :ddref:`cal.Guest`."
