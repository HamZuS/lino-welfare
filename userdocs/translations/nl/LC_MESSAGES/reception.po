"The reception module of Lino-Welfare is for managing a reception desk and"
" a waiting queue. Visitors are \"checked in\" as they present themselves "
"at a reception desk (Empfangsschalter), then they wait in a lounge until "
"an agent \"receives\" them, and finally they are \"checked out\" when "
"they leave again. Social agents have a possibility to see how many and "
"which clients are waiting for them."
